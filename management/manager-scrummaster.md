title: Manager as Scrum Master
order: 50
---

When you look at the responsibilities of a Scrum Master and that of a manager, it is difficult not to notice that they are very similar. So, this begs the question... should a manager be a Scrum Master?

## Case against

No, it is a bad idea. Why? It is hard to get teams to manage themselves, and it is difficult for managers to change their behaviour. When having a team that isn't used to being on a self-managing team and a manager who isn't used to [lean management](role_of_manager.html) then they are both likely to fail as they encourage each other to fall back to their old behavior.

Therefore, especially when the team is new to LeSS, it isn't a good idea to have the manager as Scrum Master

## Case for

As the roles are similar, it makes sense for the same person to perform it. In LeSS we consider [less roles](../principles/more-with-less.html) to be a good idea. Also, the organizational authority of a manager might help a Scrum Master in bringing changes in the organization (ironically, he wouldn't use his authority towards the team).

## Alternatives

An alternative is for a manager to be Scrum Master for a team that does not include any of their direct reports. That way, their authority won't get in the way. We've experienced mixed success with this.
