title: Self-Management

An essential part of Scrum and LeSS is self-managing teams. The term self-managing teams originates from team researcher [Richard Hackman](http://jrichardhackman.com/thinking-about-teams/) and is defined as:

> The team is responsible for executing the tasks **and** monitoring and managing process and progress.

This has profound implications to the role of managers.

## Types of teams

Figure 1 shows four different types of teams:

* manager-lead teams
* self-managing teams
* self-designing teams
* self-governing teams

They also show four responsibilities:

* executing the task
* monitoring and managing process and progress
* designing the team and its organizational context
* setting the direction

LeSS implies *at least* self-managing teams and that means that the monitoring and managing process and progress belongs to the team and *not* to the manager.

## Implications on the manager responsibilities

Changing from manager-lead teams to self-managing teams has huge implications on [the role of managers](role_of_manager.html). It means that:

* the team checks whether they are on track (monitor the progress)
* the team takes action when not on track (manage the progress)
* the team decides how to work (managing the process)
* the team resolves team conflict and fixes problems in the team (monitor and manage the process)

Hence, it is *not* part the managers responsibility to

* track the status of the Sprint
* have any kind of "status meeting" or "manager meeting"
* tell the team what to do... or to work overtime
* decide which team member needs to be taken aside to fix production issues
* monitor the team in an "agile project management tool"
* etc.

It is important to understand that we do not want to hide information from managers either. Managers are encouraged to [Go See](go_see.html) and teams should create complete [transparency](../principles/transparency.html). But they don't use the information they get to control the team and neither do they put additional things in place to keep track of the team.
