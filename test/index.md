How well is your Scrum and LeSS understanding?

These tests are provided so you can test your knowledge of Scrum and
LeSS. We call the LeSS test, a pre-course test as it tests your basic
LeSS knowledge that you probably want to have before joining a more
thorough LeSS course. The tests:

* [Scrum Test](scrum.html)
* [LeSS Pre-course Test](pre-course.html)

Good luck with the tests!
