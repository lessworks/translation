LeSS Huge is the second LeSS Framework, which is suitable for LeSS adoptions of more than eight teams. Conceptually is it LeSS scaled up further by having multiple (smaller) LeSS frameworks stacked on top of each other.

## What’s the Same as the smaller LeSS Framework

One Product Backlog, one Definition of Done, one Potentially Shippable Product Increment, one (overall) Product Owner, one Sprint. All Teams in one Sprint with one delivery.

## What’s Different?

Role changes: Area PO.

Artifact changes: “Requirement areas” in Product Backlog; Area Backlog.

Meeting changes: LeSS Huge is a set of parallel (per requirement area) LeSS Sprint executions
